Tip: Kill the spinning naga first with many skeletons

How gameplay is

There are 3 waves based on the number of kills. Each wave summons new spiders in the spawn spot.

## Still to do

1. Fix lag (was not an issue with Unity version I previously used)

2. End Menu get rid of btn menu inbetween

3. Make Waves look better

4. Fix positioning of spells, life and mana

5. Make game more interesting by adding enemies, spells and items to equip
